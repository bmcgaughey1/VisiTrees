# VisiTrees
Tree species list and related assets to support visualization applications. Assets include: simple colors for species, crown and bole shape information, images for complete trees, and images for various tree parts (bark, crown, branch). The intent is to provide an open-source resource that can be used by anyone developing visualzations involving trees.

# Starting Point
The initial tree lists came from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program and the [rSVS R package](https://github.com/Rayonier/rSVS) developed by Jim McCarter with Rayonier. FIA is responsible for the national forest inventory in the United States so their species list represents species that are measured during data collection to support the inventory. Jim's list started with the list from FIA (older version) and added additional species from the [USDA Plants Database](https://plants.usda.gov/home) maintained by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) program. The two lists are very similar. Their differences are, most likely, not significant regarding visualization needs. One significant difference is that the rSVS list includes species group codes but the FIA list does not (for the most part). While such group codes seems useful, VisiTrees implements the same capability by providing species group level visualzation assets.
